# Homie Hand is a 2D Platformer

## ALL ARTWORK IS DONE BY ME 

- The game is programmed in Java.
- There are 2 players.
- Big Player and Small Player.
- Big Player can move left and right. It can also shoot cannon balls.
- Small Player can only jump.
- Both must work together to escape the level.
- The level can only be complete when both players are at the end section, together.
- In conclusion, it is a teamwork based game.

- Once the game is fully build on local machine, I plan to integrate network capabilities.
